### Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions that cache the inverse of a matrix
## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created
## with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse
## has already been caclulated. If so, it 'get's the inverse from the cache
## and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the matrix inverse
## and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the 'setinverse' function.

## This function creates a special kind of matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x=matrix()){
  ## Initializing the inverse property
  inv <- NULL
  
  ## Method to set the matrix
  set <- function(y){
    matrix <<- y
    inv <<- NULL 
  }
  
  ## Method to get the matrix
  get <- function(){
    ## returning matrix
    matrix
  }
  
  ## Method to set the inverse of the matrix
  setInverse <- function(inverse) {
    ## storing inverse 
    inv <<- inverse
  }
  
  ## Method to get the inverse of the matrix
  getInverse <- function() {
    ## returns the inverse
    inv
  }
  
  ## Returns the list of methods
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special matrix returned by the "makeCacheMatrix" function. 
## - If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the "cachesolve" should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
